# Simplified Haskell Interpreter

I implemented an interpreter for a subset of the Haskell language in Haskell. Like Haskell, it uses [combinatory logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic). The program outputs the reduction process step by step, which was the main difficulty of this project.

This was a great opportunity for m to learn about functional programming concepts, such as immutability, higher order functions and monad transformers. This taught me how to design simple, readable and elegant solutions.

Run `przyk/run_tests.sh` (script supplied by the university) to understand how the solution works. You probably need to have cabal installed. See https://www.haskell.org/downloads/.
